Reinforcemnt Learning

Algorithms:
	Q-Learning  Off-policy
	Sarsa		On-policy
Choosing Actions:
	Epsilon-Greedy
	Softmax (Boltzman Temp)
	Greedy
	Random

Enviornment
FrozenLake https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0
has a 1 dimensional discrete state space with one dimensional discrete actions space: (F,S,H,G)

Sarsa with Softmax:

Initial agent
Final agent 300 episodes

Q-learn with epsilon greedy:

Initial agent
Final agent 100 episodes




Enviornment
MountainCar https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0
has a 2 dimensional continues state space: (position, velocity) with one dimensional discrete actions space: (left, neutral, right)
